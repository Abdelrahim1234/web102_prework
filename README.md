## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't understand the instructions when it came to opening with a live server and had ran the index.html file through a local port which didn't allow me to see the images later down the line (Challenge #3). I eventually figured it out by downloading the appropriate extension.

This is also my first time working with html this extensivly as well as javaScript. Thankfully js is similar to java which made the transition smooth.
